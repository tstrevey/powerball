# powerball

A different take on Powerball:

We'll allow for multiple players,
each player must pick 5 unique numbers (1-69) and a Powerball number (1-26)
The winning number will consist of the most frequently picked duplicated numbers, ties will be broken randomly
If there are not enough duplicates, the remaining picks will be picked at random
